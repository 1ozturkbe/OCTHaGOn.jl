//  This is a gear train design problem taken from the GAMS test library
//  
//  A compound gear train is to be designed to achieve a specific
//  gear ratio between the driver and driven shafts. The objective
//  of the gear train design is to find the number of teeth of the
//  four gears and to obtain a required gear ratio of 1/6.931.
//  
//  The problem originated from:
//  Deb, K, and Goyal, M, Optimizing Engineering Designs Using a
//  Combined Genetic Search. In Back, T, Ed, Proceedings of the
//  Seventh International Conference on Genetic Algorithms. 1997,
//  pp. 521-528.

e3:    i1 - i2 >= 0;

// the objective aimms to make the reciprocal of the
// gear ratio  as close to 6.931 as possible.
// an ideal design will have an objective equal to 1.
